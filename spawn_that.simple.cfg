# The entries listed here is a manually written list of world spawned creatures, and changes only apply to world spawners.
# Changes are applied after other Spawn That configs, so be careful not to do things like increase spawns in both world spawner and simple configs
# The list only contains the default vanilla spawns, but can be manually expanded to modded creatures too. Just add more sections.
