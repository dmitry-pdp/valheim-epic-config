# Auto-generated file for adding SpawnArea Spawner configurations.
# This file is empty by default. It is intended to contains changes only, to avoid unintentional modifications as well as to reduce unnecessary performance cost.
# Full documentation can be found at https://asharppen.github.io/Valheim.SpawnThat.
# To get started: 
#     1. Generate default configs in BepInEx/Debug folder, by enabling WriteSpawnTablesToFileBeforeChanges in 'spawn_that.cfg'.
#     2. Start game and enter a world, and wait a short moment (ca. 10 seconds) for files to generate.
#     3. Go to generated file, and copy the spawners you want to modify into this file
#     4. Make your changes.
# To find modded configs and change those, enable WriteConfigsToFile in 'spawn_that.cfg', and do as described above.
